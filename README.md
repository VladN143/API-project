# API-project
 In this project, I developed an API that allows a phone to connect to an ESP32 microcontroller via Bluetooth
Low Energy. Afterwards, the microcontroller connects to the Internet via Wi-Fi and sends the acquired data
back to the userâ€™s phone using serializations and deserializations.
